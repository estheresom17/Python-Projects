# Python-Projects
This is a repository for my python projects in my journey to becoming a python developer through the 100 days of python program with THE APP BREWERY.

**Day 1**  
This was completed on the 29th of August 2024 which is day 1 of my journey with THE APP BREWERY on 100 Days of Python. I have created a simple band name generator that will ask to succesive questions before promptly suggesting a possible band name.
